# Summary
A python script that uses MD5 hash/digest of files to find duplicate files. Since it uses contents of file instead of its name, it is able to find duplicate files even if they are named differently.

## Usage
  - `python FindDuplicateFilesInDir.py`
  - `python3 FindDuplicateFilesInir.py`
  - `./FindDuplicateFilesInDir.py`
  
  **Enter full path specific to the OS you are running for example:**
  
  `Windows-> C:\Users\Xyz\Documents`
  
  `Linux-> /home/Xyz/Documents`
